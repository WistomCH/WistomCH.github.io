 <h1> About Myself</h1>
  I'm Cindy. I'm a 13-year-old girl who likes playing a variety of sports like basketball, tennis, swimming and running. I also love to do some other interesting things in my spare time. My favorite among them is reading fictions, like Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, Wonder, and so on.

  <h2> I like reading fictions and movies.</h2>
  <p> While reading this series of fictions, I always feel like I was grabbed into it. It feels like I'm Harry Potter who was grabbed into every thrilling event and every magical adventure. The part that impressed me the most in addition to the adventures is the Quidditch Game. Swirl, rise, head down, fall over and back again, dive, and catch the golden snotch at last. The feeling is fabulous. I alo the like the movie homeless to Harvard. The main character Liz was born in a poor family of Aids. However, instead of dwelling on the frustration, she studied so hard, and was finally supported by New York Times and qualified for Harvard.  </p>

  <h3>I like travelling.</h3>
  <p> I've been to Yellow Stone National Park in which whe learned the native settlers and appreciate natural sites. We saw deers and buffalos and squirells. It's incredible.</p>
